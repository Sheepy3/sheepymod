## What is
Mod revamping minecraft's gameplay pre-iron age. Redoing first night, crafting, and early game survival in general.

I'm not a huge fan of how quickly you can skip over minecraft's early-game. you can get full iron in like 10 minutes, and everything after that is a breeze. I want to make minecrafts earlygame more challenging while also making sure it is not tedious and boring. I want to integrate heavily with vanilla and stay true to pre-microsoft minecraft's system-esque nature. This means introducing things that synergize extremely well with everything else, are multipurpose, and expose novel ways of playing. If stampylonghead can't make a new minigame from a feature, it not good enough.

## Planned features
* thatch blocks, stairs, slabs
* early game resources (twigs, sharp rocks, grass, mud brick)
  * taking advantage of mud in a more realistic way 
* early game crafting revamp (extend period pre-crafting table)
    * revamped campfire (it goes out lol)
    * Carving Bench
    * Weaving Bench
    * Charcoal Pit
    * MudBrick Furnace
    * Casting furnace (Cast ingots!) 
    * revamped anvil (crafting metal tools)
* bronze (stone tools w/ higher durability)
  * tin!
  * insert cool ideas for tin here
* Wild animal AI improvements (they run away)
* Early game weapon options (Sling, Spear)
* Firestarting (bow drill)
* natural overgrowth?
