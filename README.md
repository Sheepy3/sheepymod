## What is
Mod revamping minecraft's gameplay pre-iron age. Redoing first night, crafting, and early game survival in general.

I'm not a huge fan of how quickly you can skip over minecraft's early-game. you can get full iron in like 10 minutes, and everything after that is a breeze. I want to make minecrafts earlygame more challenging while also making sure it is not tedious and boring. I want to integrate heavily with vanilla and stay true to pre-microsoft minecraft's system-esque nature. This means introducing things that synergize extremely well with everything else, are multipurpose, and expose novel ways of playing. If stampylonghead can't make a new minigame from a feature, it not good enough.
